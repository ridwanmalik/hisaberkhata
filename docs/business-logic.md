# Business Logic

The rules of the system, concisely. Source of truth: `lib/repo.ts` (balance
effects), `lib/hooks.ts` (derived numbers), `lib/types.ts` (shapes).

## Accounts

- Types: `bank`, `mfs` (mobile wallet), `cash`, `credit`.
- Credit: **negative balance = dues**; `creditLimit` optional.
- Debit cards (`cards[]`) attach to bank/mfs accounts only — display-only,
  never a money source.
- Deleting an account deletes every transaction recorded on it.
- **No silent balance writes.** Opening balances are "Opening balance"
  adjustment entries (dated at creation); editing a balance records a
  "Balance adjusted" entry of the delta. Invariant:
  **balance = Σ(entry effects), always.**

## Transactions & balance effects

| Type                  | Account balance effect                       |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `income`              | +amount                                      |
| `expense` (no parent) | −amount                                      |
| `withdrawal` (parent) | −(amount + fee) — the cash lives in the container, fee is spending |
| `borrow` (parent)     | none if cash in hand (`accountId: ""`); +amount if it landed in an account |
| `repayment`           | −amount on the account it was paid from      |
| `transfer`            | −(amount + fee) on source, +amount on destination |
| `adjustment`          | +amount (signed — the only type where amount can be negative) |
| `expense` (child)     | none — only reduces the container remainder  |

- Amounts are always positive; direction comes from `type`.
- Editing an amount applies the delta to the account; deleting reverses the
  full effect. Deleting a container deletes its children; deleting a borrow
  also deletes its repayments, refunding each to its account.
- Edits also cover: transfer `fee` (delta moves the source balance) and
  borrow `person` (cascades to the display copy on its repayments).
- Every transaction is editable from the global edit sheet (tap any row);
  invariants are re-checked on every edit.

## Containers (the core model)

- `withdrawal` and `borrow` are **parent containers** of spendable cash.
- Child expenses attach via `parentId`, lazily, over days.
- `remainder = parent.amount − Σ(children)` — always visible.
- **Invariant: Σ(children) ≤ parent.amount.** A parent can't shrink below
  what was already spent from it.

## Borrows & debt

- A borrow tracks two independent lifecycles:
  1. **The money**: cash-in-hand borrows are containers (spend via children);
     account borrows credit the account and hold no cash (`holdsCash`) —
     no children, no cash-in-hand contribution, remainder 0.
  2. **Debt**: `owed = amount − Σ(repayments)`; settled at 0. Same for both.
- **Invariant: Σ(repayments) ≤ borrow.amount.** A borrow can't shrink below
  what was already repaid.
- Repayments reference the borrow via `borrowId` and copy `person` for
  display. They can be paid from an account (−amount) or from a cash
  container (child row, no balance effect — reduces the remainder).

## Transfers

- Move money between two accounts (`toAccountId`); neither income nor expense.
- Only the optional **fee** is real spending — it counts in monthly Spent
  under the `fees` category. The moved amount never touches Income/Spent.
  (Withdrawal fees work the same way — ATM/cash-out charges.)
- Paying a credit card bill = transfer into the credit account (dues shrink).
- Source ≠ destination; label is denormalized at creation ("From → To").
- Deleting reverses both sides (source gets amount + fee back).

## Dashboard numbers

Computed in one place: `summarizeMoney` in `lib/money.ts`.

- **You have** = Σ non-credit balances + Σ max(0, credit balances)
  + Σ container remainders. Only money that exists.
- **You owe** = Σ credit dues + Σ outstanding borrows. Shown as a quiet
  corner line, never subtracted from the big number.
- Monthly Income/Spent/Cash-out exclude borrows, repayments, and
  adjustments — each gets its own quiet line. Debt movement and balance
  corrections are never income or spending.
- **Account statement** (per account, per month): closing = stored balance −
  Σ(effects after month end); opening = closing − Σ(effects in month).
  Children excluded, incoming transfers included (`accountEffect` in
  `lib/money.ts`). "Opening balance" entries fold into the start balance of
  their own month and never appear as statement activity. "Cash in hand" on
  the accounts page is virtual — Σ of container remainders, not a real
  account.

## Recurring & budgets (Phase 2)

- `recurring_items`: bills/income templates by `dayOfMonth` — projections
  only, they never create transactions themselves.
- Budget page is a **plan, never balances**: Free after bills = planned
  income − planned bills (full-month recurring totals), tracked against
  actual Spent. Current balances belong to home only.
- Budgets: one monthly limit per category; setting a budget ≤ 0 deletes it.
